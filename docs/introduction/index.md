# Dialogue Schema

This is the documentation for the dialogue schema of the [LoreHub](https://LoreHub.app).

Whenever you do export the dialogue it will generate a JSON file that starts from [Export Schema](../dialogue-schema-api/export-schema/v1.md)

The LoreHub itself is a powerful world-building and dialogue-building tool that is free for indie game developers. It has an internal open-source [Java Script player](https://github.com/lore-hub-app/dialog-player-js) to debug dialogues and test them, but you can create your own implementation.

The schema is independent from the game engine internals which allows for more flexibility. It also allows to use the same dialogs in any game engine hence reducing development time and effort. 
Dialog schema is a schema to use for any dialogue system. It is independent of any game engine, game or genre. If you are building an RPG with dialog in it, you can use this schema without modifying your existing code base at all or do some minor changes.
